**Replication Data for Remote Damage Detection of Power Plants Using Deep Learning Based Drone Image Analysis** is a dataset for object detection tasks. It is used in the drone inspection and damage detection domains, and engineering research. Possible applications of the dataset could be in the energy industry. 

The dataset consists of 1136 images with 1136 labeled objects belonging to 1 single class (*damage*).

Images in the Damage Detection of Power Plants dataset have bounding box annotations. All images are labeled (i.e. with annotations). There are 4 splits in the dataset: *Solar_large* (122 images), *Solar_small* (516 images), *Solar_small_IR* (67 images), and *Wind* (431 images). The dataset was released in 2020 by the [Green University of Bangladesh](https://green.edu.bd/) and [University of Liberal Arts Bangladesh](https://ulab.edu.bd/).
