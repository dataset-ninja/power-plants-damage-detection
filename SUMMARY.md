**Replication Data for Remote Damage Detection of Power Plants Using Deep Learning Based Drone Image Analysis** is a dataset for an object detection task. It is used in the drone inspection and damage detection domains, and in the engineering research. Possible applications of the dataset could be in the energy industry. 

The dataset consists of 1136 images with 1136 labeled objects belonging to 1 single class (*damage*).

Images in the Damage Detection of Power Plants dataset have bounding box annotations. All images are labeled (i.e. with annotations). There are no pre-defined <i>train/val/test</i> splits in the dataset. Alternatively, the dataset could be split into 4 image-sets: ***solar_small*** (516 images), ***wind*** (431 images), ***solar_large*** (122 images), and ***solar_small_IR*** (67 images). The dataset was released in 2020 by the Green University of Bangladesh and University of Liberal Arts Bangladesh.
