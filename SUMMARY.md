**Replication Data for Remote Damage Detection of Power Plants using Deep Learning based drone image analysis** is a dataset for object detection tasks. It is used in the industrial industry.

The dataset consists of 1136 images with 1136 labeled objects belonging to 1 single class (*damage*).

Images in the Damage Detection of Power Plants dataset has bounding box annotations. All images are labeled (i.e. with annotations). There are 4 splits in the dataset: *Solar_large* (122 images), *Solar_small* (516 images), *Solar_small_IR* (67 images), and *Wind* (431 images). The dataset was released in 2020.

Here is the visualized example grid with annotations:
